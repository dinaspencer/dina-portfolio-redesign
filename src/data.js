            "description": "PharmaBoardroom, a B2B digital publisher focused on the pharmaceutical industry, needed to increase organic traffic to attract new advertisers and establish itself as a leading voice in the pharma sector. I used Google Analytics to identify that organic search traffic was underperforming industry benchmarks. By developing a targeted SEO strategy focused on high-value pharma keywords, I grew monthly traffic from 70,000-80,000 to over 100,000 visitors in six months—a 30% increase. I also optimized email marketing campaigns (20% improvement) and social media strategy (50% follower growth), establishing PharmaBoardroom as a more credible voice in pharmaceutical media.",
